Build a simple Django web application that should be able to do the following:
- Create, edit, and delete TODO items.
- Assign due dates
- Mark TODO items as complete.

The application should follow Django and python best practices using the guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md. The user interface should be simple and clean and should use Django templates.
